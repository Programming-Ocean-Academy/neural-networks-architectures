        "\n",
        "This paper delivers a **comprehensive survey** of *Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)* models — architectures that enable dynamic sparsity by activating only a subset of parameters for each input. MoE models address the escalating computational demands of dense large models and their inability to handle heterogeneous or multimodal data effectively. Through selective expert activation, MoE achieves scalable efficiency and improved specialization across domains like computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). The survey organizes advances across algorithms, theory, and applications, forming a cohesive foundation for future work.\n",
